        <br>
        <p>
            
            I'm a creative studying in information technology and multimedia  design 
            looking to archive all my academic or personal projects somewhere for future 
            viewing. I've had years of experience in web design and other forms of computer
            graphics, and look to continue my pursuit of this hobby with this site as a
            repository of all my work. Hope you enjoy!
